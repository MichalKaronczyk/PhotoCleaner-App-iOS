# PhotoCleaner

PhotoCleaner is a lightweight iOS app that helps you quickly clean up your photo library. It works like Tinder for your photos: each image appears on screen and you swipe left to delete it or swipe right to keep it.

## Features
- Requests access to your photo library and loads your images
- Swipe left to delete a photo, swipe right to keep it
- Shows one photo at a time for focused review
- Uses `PHPhotoLibrary` to remove unwanted images

## Requirements
- iOS 15 or later
- Xcode 15 or later
- Swift 6.1

## Getting Started
1. Open `PhotoCleaner.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Choose a simulator or an iOS device.
3. Build and run.

When the app launches it will ask for access to your photos. After granting permission, review your pictures and decide with Tinder-style swipes which ones to remove.
